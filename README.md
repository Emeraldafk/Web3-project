# Solana Token Minting Application

Welcome to the Solana Token Minting Application! This application allows users to create a new mint, create a token account, and mint tokens on the Solana blockchain ecosystem.

## Features

- **Create a New Mint:** Users can create new mints for their tokens directly from the application. Mints are essential for generating new tokens on the Solana blockchain.

- **Create a Token Account:** Token accounts are required to hold tokens on the Solana blockchain. With this feature, users can create token accounts seamlessly.

- **Mint Tokens:** Once a mint and token account are created, users can mint new tokens directly from the application. Minting tokens increases the token supply and makes them available for transactions.
